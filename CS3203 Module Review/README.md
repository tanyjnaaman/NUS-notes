# CS3203 22/23 S1

I hated this module with a burning passion. It's stupid, out of date, unnecessarily heavy and unfathomably poorly designed. This is easily the worst module I've ever done. This is a requirement for my batch and the batch below me, so good luck to you poor souls. 

Can you imagine - a software engineering module can have TA's who have no software engineering experience outside of school? Well, this module can, and that should tell you enough about the quality of the content and the module. 

SOC, I'm glad you've removed this requirement for future batches.
