# EC2204 20/21 S1

## Lecturer 
Chua Yeow Hwee

## Overview of content
As the module name suggests, this is a module that covers basic accounting concepts. So I hear from my peers who did the business school equivalent, ACC1701, this module is taught a little differently in that there is slightly more focus on the _why_ behind certain accounting principles and rules, in addition to how to compute. 

The content is quite similar to the business school equivalent otherwise, and you can find more details of it in my notes. 

## Grading
You're graded on a midterm, project, and final exam. 

The midterm and final exam are primarily computation based questions that I find very reasonable in difficulty - if you've paid attention in class, revised well, you'll find yourself able to score pretty well. Be careful, though - the questions can be quite tricky - they really require to have a good understanding of what's going on.

The project requires you (in a team of 2-3) to use the accounting principles you picked up in class to carry out a SWOT (strengh, weakness, opportunities, threats) analysis on a company of your choice in the form of a report and a presentation. Some interesting choices were rising firms like Netflix, AMD. My group did it on a firm called eHealth, because they had really poor financial health despite reporting seemingly healthy profits. 

Choose your project group wisely! It's not a very challenging project - my group finished it in a week with just two people (the third member unfortunately had a family member pass away, and we decided to cover for her, though she definitely pulled her weight), and the crux of it comes down to choosing an interesting company that reflects the difference between _accounting_ and _economic_ principles - think about whether the _accounting_ details (e.g. profit) being reported **accurately** reflect the underlying economic performance of the company. 

## Workload

Pretty manageable. I watched lectures, did the tutorials on time, and started on the project about a week before the deadline, made notes before each exam. Typical stuff. Took no more than 2 hours on a weekly basis (the concepts are very digestable, prof teaches really well), and the project probably took no more than 30 hours in total.

A very comfortable 6/10 difficulty type of module.

## How I studied for it

Read the textbook! It's super helpful, because sometimes prof cannot cover all the _why's_ in class (he hints at them, or goes through them briefly) and the textbook does a really good job of covering it. However, there are no soft copies I know of, so I got a copy off of Carousell that was pretty cheap.

Otherwise, just treat the module with respect - revise, make notes, be consistent, and you'll do great.

## My thoughts, and would I recommend it?
A highly, highly recommended module. Prof Chua is excellent - he is sharp, clear with his explanations and very engaging in class. 

I took this module because I'm a double degree student who has to replace a module with any EC-coded 2k module, and I'm really glad I took this. 

If you're coming from an economics background, prof Chua motivates the creation of this course as the link between economic theory and the real world - that is, how is our economic data collected, and how do they accurately (or not) represent economic activity we try to understand and model in our more theory-heavy classes? 

If you're not coming from an economics background, I still recommend this module just because of how good prof Chua is, and how interesting the project is (and how it encourages you to actually apply theory systematically on a real-world example). 

It can't be SU-ed though, but like I said in previous sections, it's a really manageable module.

## Final grade
A+
