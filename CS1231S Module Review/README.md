# CS1231S Discrete Structures 20/21 S2

## Lecturer

Aaron Tan

## Overview of content

See [the course website](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1231s/1_module_info/desc.html) and [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1231S/discrete-structures) for more details.

The course introduces some important mathematical tools for reasoning in computer science, and in most universities would probably be equivalent to "proofs" or "discrete maths" or the like. Topics include: 

* Logic and proof techniques
* Number theory
* Set theory
  * Relations and functions
  * Equivalence classes and partitions
  * Set cardinality
* Trees and graphs
* Counting and combinatorics

and more, and change slightly depending on the semester and who it's taught by. 

If I were to ELI5 it, I'd say that the content is structured in a way to provide you with the tools to model a lot of things you'll see in later CS modules mathematically, and is probably nothing you would have previously seen in JC (unless you took H3 math). You generally learn how to model stuff mathematically and reason about them rigorously with proofs (and some of them are super huge brain - great stuff!)

## Grading and exams

Midterm and a final. Mostly writing proofs. I found them really hard. I distinctly recall being murdered by the midterm, but did much better for the finals. Study hard.


## Workload

One of my heavier modules that semester. I'd say I spent about 2-3h on lectures, 2-6 hours on tutorials (I'm not naturally gifted at math, lol), and nearing finals, I'd say I spent anywhere between 2-4h per chapter revising to make sure I really understood it. It's not a light mod, and certainly a heavy one if you're not very familiar with this style of math and want to get good at it.

## How I studied for it

Honestly, in hindsight I wish I focused more on practice. The concepts introduced and writing proofs is really something that needs digesting and practice - staring at it, making notes, etc., doesn't do much to really internalize it, because you've been taught a set of *tools*, not stuff to memorize or use blindly. 

I spent a good amount of my time doing past year papers, and really going through the answer key in the tutorials to understand them, but I wish I spent even more time just sourcing for questions and discussing them and picking them apart. I did have the fortune of a really good TA, though. 

In short: try really hard to ask a lot of questions, really, really understand the material, and practice, practice, practice. This module is so important in doing well for higher level classes (especially the really interesting algorithms classes). 

## My thoughts

One of my favourite classes I've taken at SoC. Prof Aaron teaches alright, but the material in itself I find very interesting - it genuinely changed the way I looked at and felt about math, and in some ways the way I see and reason about the world. The content is generally relevant for higher level CS modules - especially CS2040S and other algorithms classes, and the skills taught are relevant to me to this day, in Y4, as I write this (it is worth noting, however, that I'm taking algorithms and theory-heavy ML courses). 

The only thing I wish this class also covered were things like automata theory, or in general concepts that were also introduced in the equivalent class at other top CS schools.

## Final grade

A- (better than expected!)
