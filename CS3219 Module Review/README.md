# CS3219 22/23 S1

## Lecturer
Wadhwa Bimlesh, Akshay Narayan

## Overview of content
The module attempts to introduce, at a very high level, software engineering design concepts. Where, in comparison, CS2103 introduces everything - version control, basic design patterns, workflows, testing, etc., this module goes deeper into one part of that - design. 

I think the class can be condensed into: 
* requirements specification
* architecture design
* messaging systems
* design patterns
* software quality

In general, the class could honestly be condensed into half the time. Most of the lectures are a waste of time.


## Grading, exams and workload
The grading consists of 5 (pretty heavy) OTOT assignments that you can do at any time and submit by the end of the semester, a final and a group project (which also isn't light). 

1. Project

I had the misfortune of getting a pretty disfunctional group, and that really made my life hell. e.g. Due to miscommunication or at times downright irresponsible behaviour, I had to entirely rewrite entire sections of our project. So take what I say with a pinch of salt - it comes from the perspective of someone who did about 70-85% of the project (code wise and report wise). I would say I spent about a total of 20 hours a week on it. Which really sucked with 2 TA positions, haha. 

You can find my repo [here](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2223S1/cs3219-project-ay2223s1-g47).

2. OTOT assignments

There are 5 assignments, each with a certain set of things to build. There are bonus marks for completing them by a certain time or doing special tasks (e.g. writing a technical article). 

The assignments are honestly quite interesting, and exposed me to new tech stacks I'd never worked with, or deepened my understanding of them. Some stacks I can name as part of the assignments - AWS, K8s, Docker, Nginx, Kafka, etc. Key concepts introduced in the assigments - containerization, reverse proxies, caching, building and deploying a webapp and distributed systems/replication. Pretty cool stuff! 

Just not very easy if you're new. If you've worked before, you should find it manageable.

3. Finals

Total bullshit final. Most of the questions are abstract and debatable. I question so much of it. I got an A for the project, full for the assignments, but got an A-. Frustrating. 

## My thoughts

Take this module **only if you have a full team of 4 to do it with**, or at least another very technically solid friend. I did not. It was hell. 

This module is interesting and useful if you've never worked before - it does a reasonably good job introducing a lot of concepts and tech stacks you see and use in real life. But if you've worked at any generally high-performing organization, this will be a waste of time. 

Of the 12 lectures, probably only 3-4 are useful, and all of it can be condensed to be covered in half the time, even keeping all the examples used. The tutorials are frustratingly useless (but participation is graded??). The project is actually reasonably well designed, because it's a sufficiently difficult task but bounded enough to keep it difficult. The assignments are also interesting, if a little heavy. The final is absolutely nonsensical. 

In all, I would not recommend this module if you've worked or interned before. If you haven't, then maybe give it a go. 

## Final grade 
A-
