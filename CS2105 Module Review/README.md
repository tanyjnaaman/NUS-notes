# CS2105 Computer Networks 22/23 S1

## Lecturer

Zhou Lifeng, Jithin Vachery

## Overview of content

Provides some pretty important knowledge about how computers communicate. The module starts off introducing high level ideas of what computer networks are and the general layered architecture of communication networks. It then dives deep into the individual layers - application, transport, network, link (omits physical), and the rounds off the module with important topics like network security (basics of cryptography, symmetric/asymmetric key schemes, etc.) and multimedia networking.

## Grading and exams

Straightforward stuff - a midterm, a final and 3 graded assignments. All assessments aren't hard, just a little tricky - so be sure to understand concepts well. They are generally well designed and fair.

## Workload

Honestly, might be the lightest mod I've ever taken in NUS.

On average, it's about 40-50 min lectures (at 2x speed) and about 25 minutes to do the tutorial every week. I skipped tutorials all semester. Assignments took me about 3-6 hours on average. Preparation for the midterms and finals took me about 1-2 days of studying and doing PYPs (there aren't many, all I have, I put here).

## My thoughts

Overall, this is a pretty good class, and one of the few I really enjoyed this semester.

The content is overall very useful and easy to digest - for anyone who has done an internship and worked with HTTP APIs (as I did, before this class), this module really helps to illuminate the things you pick up and use in real life.

I'm grateful that the mod is as light as it is, because this semester was a really rough one for me - I worked until week 3 (effectivey skipped class) and TA'ed for two classes. Despite that, I was able to catch up and do fine.

As of the batch below me, it's not a compulsory module, but I _highly recommend it, and cannot recommend taking it enough_. It's easy to manage, has very applicable knowledge, and is generally interesting without being overly bogged down on details.

## Final grade
