# CS3230 21/22 S2

## Lecturer
Warut Suksompong

## Overview of content 
In short, the module is exactly what it is - about the design and analysis of algorithms. The course is structured in a way such that concepts build on one another, and covers a good breadth of new concepts as well as going deeper for those we've seen before. In order, the class covers:
* Correctness of algorithms (e.g. loop invariants)
* Analysis of recursive algorithms (e.g. master method, substitution method)
* Probabilistic analysis 
* Randomized algorithms
* Hashing
* Streaming
* Amortized analysis
* Dynamic programming
* Greedy algorithms
* Reductions, P vs. NP problems

In general, the content is interesting, if a little dry at times. I think most people will find dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, reductions/P and NP to be very interesting new concepts, but some parts like the intricacies of hashing might be a little too... math-ey at times. 

## Grading and exams

Prof Warut's assessment methods are extremely fair. You have weekly assignments, alternating in whether they are graded by effort (if you do it, full marks) and correctness. They aren't too difficult, and in my view, very formative in nature - I found that doing them really helped to deepen my understanding of the course material. 

Then there's a midterm, a final, and two optional programming assignments (that allow you to get marks if you lost them doing weekly ones). 

The midterm was **very** challenging, but I think in part because my understanding of hashing was weak. I failed it! I was around 25th percentile, I think. Kinda on me though - I was overcommited and really should have revised more than I did. But for context, I think the 75th percentile was something like 32/60, so the whole class didn't do great. 

The final was much better for me personally, but in general I also found it very fair. If you understood the concepts well, you'd do fine (and I guess, I did?). 

## Workload
Honestly, it was one of my lighter classes for the semester. I spent maybe 2h a week watching the lecture and doing the tutorial, maybe another 2h doing the assignment. Nearing finals, I studied maybe 2 hours a week or so on it. This module is more about the difficulty and subtleties of the concepts taught, more than the amount of hours required, I think. 

Just be consistent with the lectures, tutorials and assignments (in my view, the concepts need some time to really be digested), and you'll do fine.

## How I studied for it

First half of the class, I really didn't and regretted it. The second half, I put more time into discussing assignments with my friends (it really helped to clarify my misconceptions), stayed consistent with lectures, tutorials, and generally took the module more seriously. 

## My thoughts
One of my favourite classes I've taken at SOC, actually. Prof Warut is really fair with his assessments (they are hard, but you don't feel like he's unreasonable at any time, and a lot of the things he does feels very formative for you as a student), he teaches clearly in class, and the material is generally interesting. 

It's a compulsory module for all CS students, but for the non-CS but mathematically curious students, I'd say take it! I promise you won't regret it. 

## Final grade
A- (I must have somehow done well in the final, because my midterms were really bad)
