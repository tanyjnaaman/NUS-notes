  <h1 align="center">NUS Module Notes and Reviews</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This is a repository where I keep my notes, grades and reviews for modules I've taken. 
  </p>
</p>

I've personally always found it very useful to read about other's experiences before taking a module, especially so when they shared their notes for reference. So, for all the people who've helped me, I'm just paying it forward. Hope this helps someone out there.
