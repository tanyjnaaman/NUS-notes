# CS4243 21/22 S2

## Lecturer 
Xavier Bresson

## Overview of content
Fantastic. 

This module goes for a good amount of breadth and enough depth for deep learning for computer vision. The first six weeks are really chill, because Prof Xavier goes from the fundementals of a a multilayer perceptron to backpropagation, all the way to a fundemental convolutional neural network. Important fundementals like the intuition and derivation behind cross-entropy, how to compute gradients, neural networks as non-linear transforms and template matching, etc., alongside weekly labs done in PyTorch. Good stuff and very accessible.

Then after the midterm break, every week he goes through a new "area" of computer vision - best practices, visualising neural networks, object detection, image segmentation, 3D vision and image generation/translation. You don't have to, but he cites a lot of readings in his slides, and I read most of them. Really insightful stuff, and I'd encourage you to do that too. 

## Grading and exams
### Tests
The workload for this module isn't light, but I also wouldn't say it's crazy heavy. You have weekly ungraded labs, 2 theory quizzes (one on MLPs and fundementals of deep learning, the other on CNNs specifically) and 2 practical exams for PyTorch implementation. They are fair assessments - if you revise and are consistent with the labs, you'll do fine. 

### Project
These assessments make up 70% of your grade. The other 30% comes from a team project, where you propose some project, **build your own dataset** and build, train and tune models according to your project proposal and document it with a video presentation and set of notebooks/`.py` files. Mine was focused on image inpainting. 

The project can get heavy - I produced mine in about a week of non-stop work, but I would say I learnt a lot on really getting into the nitty gritty of building, cleaning, exploring your own dataset, building your own train-load-evaluation-visualization/thinking pipeline. If you've stayed consistent with the lectures and readings from those lectures, I highly encourage you to do interesting, difficult things. 

Logistics of the project can get difficult, though, particularly because collaboration in the deep learning area is hard. You need lots of storage, GPU access, etc., and infrastructure to support experiment tracking. Personally, I found success with [DagHub](https://towardsdatascience.com/dagshub-a-github-supplement-for-data-scientists-and-ml-engineers-9ecaf49cc505?gi=9bf9c94a4caf) and WandB for version control and experiment tracking. Hope you do, too. 

## Workload 
The first six weeks took me about 2.5h a week (pretty light for a CS mod!), watching the lecture (there's not much readings, just theory) and then going through the labs. 

I studied for each of the quizzes in about 2-6 hours for each. Very manageable. 

The second six weeks were heavier - I spent about 10h a week on the module on average, with 2h for the lectures, another 2h for readings, 1-2h for labs (they get harder, and Prof Xavier's code can be a little spaghetti) and about 3h or so on the project (building your own dataset is really tedious). But still, 10h a week is still very reasonable. 

The last week, because of neglecting the project for my other mods, I did literature review, implemented/trained/tuned a total of about 38 models as well as refined my training pipeline in 4 consecutive days of week 13. Moral of the story is, you can last minute this project, but even last-minute-ing will take time. 

## How to study for it
I think being consistent with the module - again, lectures, readings, labs - really helps. For the project in particular, I think referencing Stanford's CS231n's projects are really useful (and so are their slides/notes), and I highly recommend it.

## My thoughts
I'm glad Prof Xavier is now teaching at NUS. Though he can be quite hands-off, he is clear with his teaching and sufficiently rigorous with the concepts introduced. His assessments are also fair. He also teaches CS5242 Deep Learning 1, and I'd say this is pretty close in terms of rigour and difficulty (just without some concepts, like attention or LSTMs, and the pace is a little slower). 

I highly recommend this module under Prof Xavier. 

## Final grade
Not seen the A+ in a while. I hope this will be one.
