# CS2100 Computer Organization 20/21 S2

## Lecturer

Colin Tan, Aaron Tan

## Overview of content

This module covers the basics of how a computer fundementally works. A lot of high-level yet fundemental content is covered in the first half of the module, and these are:

1. Introduction to number systems (representing numbers)
2. Introduction to C programming
3. Introduction to instruction set architectures (MIPS and general ISA design)
4. Processors and data paths (instruction -> path ... -> result)
5. Control signals (in processors)

These topics may seem daunting for just six weeks, and well, they are. The pace of the lectures go at a blinding pace, so be prepared. But, you learn a lot.

The next six weeks cover more abstract content, and some prefer it to the first half. I felt indifferent. The topics are:

6. Boolean algebra
7. Logic circuits
8. Boolean function simplification
9. Combinatorial circuits
10. Medium Scale Integrated components
11. Sequential circuits
12. Pipelining
13. Caching

The second half topics are more abstract, and in some cases require more pattern recognition and "big brain moments". Good luck.

## Grading

Lab, midterm and final. The labs are free marks, so don't worry about it, but they're also not a waste of time. I recommend going for them.

The midterm and final were brutal.

The midterm, I failed, but I was well above the 75th percentile, I think. It consisted of 20 questions, and everything learnt in the first half is tested - so be sure to deeply understand (and be able to manipulate things) with novel number systems, instruction set architectures, and really familiarize yourself with the datapath. You'll get what I mean when you do the past year midterms.

The final is pretty standard every year - every topic will be tested, and I recommend gunning for the pipelining and caching questions (and doing them correctly, carefully) because they are mechanical and easy to score if you're careful. The other questions tend to require higher order thinking and more time. I did well, but it was only with a lot of work and practice.

## Workload

This has to be one of the hardest modules I've done in NUS, even when I look at the higher level modules. It is intellectually challenging, and extremely content rich (every lecture is relentless, there really is so much content being taught). I found this module harder and invested significantly more time into it relative to the other "killer" CS foundation modules like CS1231S and CS2030S, even CS2040S (maybe I spent about the same time on CS2040S, though).

Good luck!

## How I studied for it

Rewatched lecture recordings (so much content, I couldn't digest without repeated watches), doing tutorials consistently, making notes, reading the textbook. In Prof Aaron's section (second half of the module) in particular, I highly recommend reading his textbook - it is clear and excellently written, and I promise it's not useless or verbose information being presented in it.

## Some thoughts

A very eye opening and insightful module that CS students must take, and I can see why. I learned so much. I would never like to do it again, though.

## Final grade
