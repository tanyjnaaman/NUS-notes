# EC101 20/21 S2

## Lecturer: 
Timothy Wong Chong Ji

## Overview of content
This module kinda just goes deeper from the content of EC2101. E.g. In EC2101 you study finding an optimal consumption basket given prices and a budget constraint - you do the same
in EC3101, but with an element of time or uncertainty (as in probability). You also study some game theory and firm theory. Overall, pretty interesting stuff. 

## Grading and exams
Standard stuff. Tutorial participation, lecture quizzes, 2 assignments, midterms, finals.

## Workload
Overall, I think this is a pretty manageable mod. It's 1 lecture and 1 tutorial a week, and Prof Wong goes at a pretty reasonable pace. The content isn't easy (especially 
game theory and firm theory), but it isn't mind blowingly hard either. I'd say on average I spent about 2 hours on lecture + lecture quiz, 1 hour on doing the tutorial, and 
nearing the examination period, about 2-3 hours a week revising.

## How I studied for it
I stayed pretty consistent with lectures, quizzes every week, including reading the textbook (optional, but I found it personally very useful - it goes deeper into the intuition of the content covered 
in class!). About 3 weeks before assessments, I would prepare cheatsheets to summarize my knowledge.

## My thoughts
Overall, I'd say this is a pretty enjoyable module. Prof Wong is a pretty cool guy - he took the time to drop us an email after the midterms and finals to assure us if we didn't do 
too well, and to stay focused and not be complacent if we did do well (I didn't do well, lol). He also takes the time to answer a lot of questions - I had plenty of them, and he 
was very patient with a lot of them (also very responsive!). The content is also interesting, the workload is manageable and the assessments felt fair. A solid 7/10 module.

## Final grade
A
