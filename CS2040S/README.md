## Overview of content
A really fundemental and important course for everything computing, much like CS2100, CS2030S (and all the other CS cores, really). The material is comprehensive and builds on fundementals from CS1231S (in terms of proofs of correctness, running time, etc.). 

The first half up to the midterm covers: 
* Asymptotic analysis 
* Sorting algorithms 
* List-based ADTs - ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, Stack
* Map ADT: Hashing 
* Bloom filter

The second half (which was in my opinion, much harder, but much more fun):
* Priority Queue ADT: Heap
* Union-find disjoint set
* Ordered Map ADT: (balanced) binary search trees, trie, AVL trees, splay trees
* Graph data structures
* Fundemental graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, topological sort
* Weighted spanning trees: Prim's, Kruskal's algorithms
* Single source shortest path algorithm
* All-pair shortest path algorithms e.g. Floyd Warshall
