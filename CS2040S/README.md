# CS2040S 20/21 S1

## Lecturer

## Overview of content
A really fundemental and important course for everything computing, much like CS2100, CS2030S (and all the other CS cores, really). The material is comprehensive and builds on fundementals from CS1231S (in terms of proofs of correctness, running time, etc.). 

The first half up to the midterm covers: 
* Asymptotic analysis 
* Sorting algorithms 
* List-based ADTs - ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, Stack
* Map ADT: Hashing 
* Bloom filter

The second half (which was in my opinion, much harder, but much more fun):
* Priority Queue ADT: Heap
* Union-find disjoint set
* Ordered Map ADT: (balanced) binary search trees, trie, AVL trees, splay trees
* Graph data structures
* Fundemental graph algorithms e.g. BFS, DFS, topological sort
* Weighted spanning trees e.g. Prim's, Kruskal's algorithms
* Single source shortest path algorithm e.g. Dijkstra's
* All-pair shortest path algorithms e.g. Floyd Warshall

## Grading and exams
The grading consisted of weekly labs some assignments (some of which were very hard, like the one on AVL Trees), a midterm and a final. 

## Workload
Probably one of the heaviest, but most fun modules I've ever done. The intensity - having consistent tutorials (which focused on theory) and labs (which focused on writing code) - really drilled the fundementals into my head. I think I spent close to 10 hours a week on this module (which is technically 4MCs, but most 4MC modules don't actually need 10 hours).

## How I studied for it
Just practiced a ton of Visual Algo, really focused on thinking through tutorials, labs and assignments, and when it came to making notes, I spent a lot of time thinking about potential problem-types I could apply the learnt algorithms to (especially for graphs).

I'd simply say to be consistent with tutorials and labs, and try to do assignments early (they can be pretty hard at times). Ideally, have a group of friends you can bounce off ideas with, it helps a lot. 

## My thoughts
A great module. Not that I had a choice in whether or not to take it, but it was a really fruitful class.
