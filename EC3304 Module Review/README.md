# EC3304 Econometrics II 21/22 S2

## Lecturer

Denis Tkachenko

## Overview of content

This module continues from ECC3303. You build on top of the knowledge of multiple linear regression to panel data, limited data (binary variables), intstrumental variables and finally time series regression and forecasting. Pretty cool stuff.

## Grading and exams

Simple. Participation, midterms and finals.

## Workload

Overall, I think this is a pretty manageable module. Tutorials are biweekly, which helps a lot with the workload, especially as I took five other modules this semester. The content is very digestable, though for those who are more mathematically curious, you'll have to do your own digging for proofs (as I did). The textbook's proofs are not very rigorous, but they give you enough of an idea.

## How I studied for it

I'm generally pretty curious, so I went a step further (particularly for time series forecasting, the last chapter) to search for proofs and derivations. For the less curious, I'd say that going through the appendices in the textbook is useful, because Dr. Tkachenko's questions are tricky and require a relatively good understanding of the equations gone through in class (even if without the derivations). Long story short, understand the intuition well, go through the practice questions (I've shared PDFs of what I've found online for textbook practice answers), and be relatively comfortable with the equations and how to manipulate them.

## My thoughts

Overall, a 6/10 module. I wish it was more mathematically rigorous, and more hands on. Prof Tkachenko is nice, if a little bit confusing and mumble-y at times during lecture. I'm very into stats and econometrics in general, and I think it's an interesting rounding to the introduction to regression techniques that began in EC3303.
