## Lecturer

Ghislain Fourny

## Overview of content

You can find the course details [here](https://systems.ethz.ch/education/courses/2023-spring/information-retrieval-.html).

The course generally discusses how to handle unstructured queries - how to index them (algorithms, data structures), how to do so at scale (some very specific algorithms) and thus how to answer queries (with spell correction, wildcards, ranking, etc.). 

It's generally very straightforward content that is easy to digest, and can be thought of as a relatively simple database course.

## Grading and exams

A final that was 100% of the grade - but there were assignments which you could get bonus marks from, which I did. 

## Workload

Super lightweight. A 2 hour lecture every week, and an optional assignment. Each assignment would take me about 30 minutes to do, and I found relatively manageable.


## How I studied for it

Nothing too special. Watched the lectures, did the assignments, made my notes. VIS did have [practice papers](https://exams.vis.ethz.ch/category/InformationRetrieval) with crowd-sourced solutions, which was useful!


## My thoughts

A relatively comfortable and interesting class. Because I took it alongside two tough classes (LLMs and Distributed Algorithms), I found this class to always be the breath of fresh air I needed, because it was straightforward. For the NUS kids, this is a lot like CS2105 in terms of its difficulty. It's pretty easy.

## Final grade
