# EE2211 20/21 S1

## Lecturer
Teo Chiang Juay

## Overview of content

This module covers the basics of fluid mechanics. The first half is largely on fluid statics (it will break you, but it's super cool) and the second on fluid dynamics (e.g. Bernoulli equation) and pipe flow. 

It may seem like very little content for 13 weeks of instruction, but I think it's largely because we went really deep in each of the topics. I certainly came out of it feeling like I learnt a lot.

## Grading and exams

A 70% final and 30% midterm, like all engineering modules.

## Workload 
 
Depends on you, but probably heavy. Because the weightage of the finals is so high, it's largely dependent on how you organized your time. I made it a point to be consistent because of the advice of most of my seniors, and the bi-weekly tutorials each took me about 5-6 hours to do (I found them really hard, most of them were me staring blankly until I figured it out). 

So, maybe something like 4-6 hours on lecture + 5-6 hours on tutorial every 2 weeks. Not unreasonable, just sometimes, demoralizing.


## How I studied for it

I actually consulted Prof TCJ a lot - he's incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches (going so far as to even teach me the content for my _other_ modules when I briefly mentioned it), and doing so really helped my understanding. 

Aside from that, I'd say be consistent, and really, really try hard to do the tutorials. Prof TCJ's tutorials are sometimes disgustingly hard, but very insightful and interesting when you do figure it out. It can be very demoralizing though, so keep at it!

Just as a note - the first half is very understanding focused (as in, the topics go very deep) while the second half is largely computation/formula based. So take that into account when you study for it too.

## My thoughts

Honestly, one of my favourite classes at NUS as a mechanical engineering student (at the time). Prof TCJ is passionate, extremely sharp, and extremely good at teaching (imo, one of the best profs I've ever come across). The class is pretty challenging though, and you have to be very comfortable with linear algebra and forces. 

## Final grade
