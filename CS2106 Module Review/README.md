# CS2106 22/23 S1

## Lecturer
Wong Weng Fai

## Overview of content
This module, as it suggests, introduces basic OS concepts. More specifically, it builds on the understanding gained in CS2100 and goes a level up into how the hardware and software interact to provide a usable layer of abstraction for the user. 

It begins with a refresher on program execution (the different types of memory) and uses that to segway into processes, threads and synchronization. After the midterm, the module moves onto memory abstractions (RAM) and file systems on persistent memory (hard disk). A reasonably good introduction to OS concepts. 

## Grading and exams
A midterm, final and five two-week long assignments. The midterm and final are as expected, just assessments. The assignments are hard, really hard - most of them took me 8-16 hours to complete, and often frustrated me. Turns out, though, this is a common rite of passage for all CS students. So take that how you will. 

## Workload

Not very heavy, but not light. Labs would take me about 8-16 hours on average (but one in particular took me about 2 days - the one on synchronization). Weekly lectures were about 1.5 hours - even at 2x speed, I had to rewind and rewatch very often (in part because prof Wong is often hand-wavey with his teaching). Tutorials would take me about 1-3 hours to do, YMMV, because I really didn't pay as much attention to lectures as I wish I did - most of my learning was done in the tutorial itself. 

## How I studied for it
The usual. No special tips here - made notes, tried to pay attention in lectures and tutorials, ask a lot of questions. 

I honestly didn't study as hard as I wish I did though. Considering how OS is an important fundamental, I wish I gave it more of my time and attention, as I had with other of my CS2ks. 

## My thoughts

A decent class. Prof Wong is honestly not great - he tends to be very handwavey and ambiguous, and the questions he sets can also be troublesome because of a mix of possible interpretations. Generally a little frustrating. 

That said, the concepts taught are interesting, and everything I hear about Prof Carbunaru's version of the class is great, so try to take it when she teaches it!

## Final grade
A- (I must have fluked, because god I studied so little for this class)
