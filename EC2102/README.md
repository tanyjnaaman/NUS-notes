# EC2102 21/22 S1

## Lecturer
Serene Tan

## Overview of content 
This module introduces a lot of new content and builds on the basics of using constrained optimization from EC2101. 

The first four weeks introduce a one-period model (like that in EC2101) just with the idea of a representative consumer as well as a government (and concepts like Ricardian Equivalence and social security policy). The last two weeks before the midterm extend this model into two periods, which is the central focus of the module. 

In the second half of the module, the focus is on fleshing out the two period model with a representative consumer, firm and government as well as a money market, and how they interact to achieve _competitive equilibrium_. As the intertemporal model is the fundemental model of modern macroeconomics, the module rounds off the discussion by introducing the concept of money neutrality and then the (two opposing schools of) New Keynsian and Neoclassical views on the intertemporal model.

## Grading and exams
Tutorial participation, weekly lecture quizzes, midterms, finals. Standard stuff. 

## Workload 
I wouldn't say this module was easy, particularly because to deeply understand the model introduced (particularly when we factor in money nearing the end of the module) a degree of self study was needed. Prof Serene covered most of the content pretty well, if a little too slowly at the beginning, and a little too quickly at the end. The front content, being close to EC3101 if you're taking them concurrently, feels too simple, while at the end it's easy to get lost because some derivations are hand-waved. 

On average, I think I spent 3h a week on this module - 2h on lecture + quiz, 1h on tutorial. Nearing finals, revision on the content of the second half took longer. 

## How I studied for it
I ended up entirely reorganizing the content taught in the class (in terms of the order) in my own notes as prof Serene does not follow the most intuitive flow (at least in my view). I also took the liberty of self-learning some concepts from the textbook, as some of it is relatively important but entirely skipped over in class. This took quite a lot of time. 

Apart from that, though, it was pretty standard. Make notes, redo the tutorials. The main thing I'll say is to treat this as something closer to A-levels in terms of the examination. The midterm took me by surprise by how qualitative it was (as in, you derive equations, but write to explain them), and I suffered for it. I spent a lot of time in preparation for the final charting out potential explanations for different things (like A-levels, in that sense), and for the sake of scoring I'd recommend you to do the same. 

I'm not saying blindly memorize, because you'll die (the papers aren't difficult, but also aren't easy or memorize-able), but prepare yourself on how you might explain things.

## My thoughts
A pretty good module. I think it could be taught better, but Prof Serene made an effort to be relatively rigorous and explain the intuition behind the concepts introduced. This module is important for EC3102, as the first half of it builds almost entirely on EC2102. So, pay attention, I guess. 

Not quite as good at EC2102 (maybe because Dr. Zhang Yang is 10/10, in my opinion), but a very solid module nonetheless.
