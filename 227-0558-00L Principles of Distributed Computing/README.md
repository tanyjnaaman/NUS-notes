Roger Wattenhofer

## Overview of content

You can find the course website [here](https://disco.ethz.ch/courses/podc/).

Despite its name suggesting that it might be about distributed computing, this course is really about distributed *algorithms*.

It starts off discussing the different way we think about distributed algorithms relative to classical sequential algorithms, and provides various models of synchronous and asynchronous computation.

Throughout the rest of the course, classical problems are introduced and solved with distributed algorithms, as in a typical algorithms class - except this time, distributed. Topics include: 
* vertex colouring
* broadcast/convergecast
* symmetry breaking via leader election
* maximal independent set
* local problems and lower bounds
* global problems and lower bounds
* mutual exclusion
* distributed sorting
* stabilization and fault tolerance
* wireless networks (leader election, again)
* graph neural networks
* graph labelling

It's generally very interesting, but very, very theoretical, and Prof Roger did not do the best job of being consistent with the models taught or precise with his terminology and proofs. 

## Grading and exams

A 100% 2h final, that was *super* hard.

## Workload

I wanted to die. The worst part about this class was that there wasn't much practice to work with, and the notes were unpolished and often ambiguous. I can't say the workload was high, but it was sorta high because I spent a lot of time diving into textbooks or alternative sources to try to wrap my head around the often handwavy solutions provided in tutorials or the lecture script. The tutorials were also poorly organized and IMO had pretty low learning value, which led to more time being wasted trying to self-learn the material covered in the tutorials. 

I spent about 2h a week on lectures, and 3-5 hours on the tutorial/revision.

## How I studied for it

Made notes. Googled a lot. I also honestly did not study much for it, because between studying for my other (more enjoyable classes), touring around Europe and working full time in the summer at Palantir, I didn't find much time to study. 

## My thoughts

Not a good class. I think the material is very interesting, particularly because I find myself generally interested in algorithms classes - I deeply enjoyed CS3230, for example. But this class was poorly organized and poorly taught. It is especially so because it is a proofs-heavy class, where I find the lack of precision in terminology and consistency/rigor in proofs discussed very frustrating.

## Final grade

~~If I pass I am happy~~
4.75/6.00 (I passed!)
