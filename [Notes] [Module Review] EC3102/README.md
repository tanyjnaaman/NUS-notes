# EC3102 21/22 S2

## Lecturer
Vu Than Hai

## Overview of content
In this module there's a little bit of a continuation from EC2102, particularly in the first half of the class. In the first six weeks, building on top of the modern conception of optimization in macroeconomics, the class covers the infinite period framework, fiscal and monetary policy (and their interactions) as well as the fiscal theory of exchange rates. Reasonably interesting (but not very). 

After the midterms, the module content shifts towards growth models, and the Production, Solow and Romer models are covered.

Overall, cool stuff, particularly the Romer model - where _finally_ a reasonable model of growth that correlates (somewhat) with real life is taught. 

## Grading and exams
Participation, midterms and finals. Standard stuff. Both midterms and finals were open book.

## Workload
Somewhat, but not very, heavy. The content introduced is not excruciatingly difficult, and I think it's easy to understand at a surface level, but going deep into it requires patiently going through the derivations and considering how things will change when you keep all but one thing constant. 

I think I spent about 3h a week on this module, watching the lecture and doing the tutorial (which were good as formative practice). Nearing the exam period, I'd say I spent about 1-3 hours on each chapter, making notes, going through the tutorial, etc.

## How I studied for it
Made notes, redid tutorials. As with most EC-coded modules, no past year papers.

## My thoughts

6/10 module all around. Dr. Vu is pretty average lecturer, and I found it quite frustrating when the intuition behind derivations were rarely covered, and instead just tedious mathematical manipulations were introduced. He is, however, a really nice lecturer, and took the time to email us after every assessment and encourage us.

The content is not particularly interesting (to me) and I found it a grind more often than not. The assessments in the midterm and final were a little frustrating to do (tedious qualitative explanations were required). 

I am probably not going into macroeconomics after taking this module, so take what I say with a pinch of salt.

## Final grade
With a little luck, an A. Probably an A- though.
