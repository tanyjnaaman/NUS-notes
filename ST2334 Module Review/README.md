## Lecturer
Chan Yiu Man

## Overview of content

This module introduces students to basic probability theory and statistical inference. Topics include basic concepts of probability, conditional probability, independence, random variables, joint and marginal distributions, mean and variance, some common probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation and hypothesis testing based on a normal population.


## Grading and exams

Three online quizzes (easy, but tricky) and a final (which I think takes up 70% of your grade).

## Workload 
 
Not heavy, but I also wouldn't say it was light. I skipped all tutorials (my TA was pretty bad) and watched all lectures at 2x speed. The lecture notes were pretty comprehensive, and the tutorials I think were fair and helpful to learning. That was nice. Honestly, you could skip the lectures and just read the lecture notes, but I like listening to the lecture at 2x speed while reading them. Makes me feel better somehow. 

## How I studied for it

Honestly, I didn't till finals. The first half of the course is pre-U stuff (e.g. permuations, probability) - concepts you should be familiar with, with slightly better mathematical treatment (integrals, some set notation). The second half introduces some new distributions (Bernoilli, joint normal, chi-square, F, etc.) and that's pretty cool, but if you have a good understanding of probability and statistics, you should be good!

I just made notes, did tutorials, the usual. Also, because excel or R were allowed (but not python) for the finals, I implemented some statistical test calculators with R's default library, but used RSymPy to automate symbolic calculations. The code is ugly, but it worked, haha.

## My thoughts

Decent class. A good, basic introduction to probability and statistics which builds off your understanding at A levels. Pretty hands off, totally last-minute cram-able, which helps a lot in a busy semester.

## Final grade 
A
